# Note-Taker

## Description 
This is the eleventh challenge for the UTA boot camp. This project was created to utilize Node.JS/Express.JS. For this challenge, I created a note-taker where users can enter tasks they need to accomplish and add more tasks when needed. The application consists of UUID and express NPM packages. The focus of this challenge was to understand and use the correct routing structure to work with multiple files while applying middleware to get the application running. 

## Usage 
Users can use this application to enter tasks they must accomplish throughout their busy day and add more tasks as needed to keep track of their busy schedule.
